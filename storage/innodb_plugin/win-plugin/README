This directory contains patches that need to be applied to the MySQL
source tree in order to build the dynamic plugin on Windows --
HA_INNODB.DLL. Please note the followings when adding the patches:

* The patch must be applied from the mysql top-level source directory.
  patch -p0 < win-plugin.diff
* The patch filenames end in ".diff".
* All patches here are expected to apply cleanly to the latest MySQL 5.1
  tree when storage/innobase is replaced with this InnoDB branch.

When applying the patch, the following files will be modified:

  * CMakeLists.txt
  * sql/CMakeLists.txt
  * win/configure.js

Also, two new files will be added:

  * sql/mysqld.def
  * sql/mysqld_x64.def

You can get "patch" utility for Windows from http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/
