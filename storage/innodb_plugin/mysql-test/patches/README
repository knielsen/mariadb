This directory contains patches that need to be applied to the MySQL
source tree in order to get the mysql-test suite to succeed (when
storage/innobase is replaced with this InnoDB branch). Things to keep
in mind when adding new patches here:

* The patch must be appliable from the mysql top-level source directory.

* The patch filename must end in ".diff".

* All patches here are expected to apply cleanly to the latest MySQL 5.1
  tree when storage/innobase is replaced with this InnoDB branch. If
  changes to either of those cause the patch to fail, then please check
  whether the patch is still needed and, if yes, adjust it so it applies
  cleanly.

* If applicable, always submit the patch at http://bugs.mysql.com and
  name the file here like bug%d.diff. Once the patch is committed to
  MySQL remove the file from here.

* If the patch cannot be proposed for inclusion in the MySQL source tree
  (via http://bugs.mysql.com) then add a comment at the beginning of the
  patch, explaining the problem it is solving, how it does solve it and
  why it is not applicable for inclusion in the MySQL source tree.
  Obviously this is a very bad situation and should be avoided at all
  costs, especially for files that are in the MySQL source repository
  (not in storage/innobase).

* If you ever need to add a patch here that is not related to mysql-test
  suite, then please move this directory from ./mysql-test/patches to
  ./patches and remove this text.
