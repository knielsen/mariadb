2009-02-18	The InnoDB Team

	* include/ut0mem.h, os/os0proc.c, ut/ut0mem.c:
	Protect ut_total_allocated_memory with ut_list_mutex in
	os_mem_alloc_large() and os_mem_free_large(). The lack of this mutex
	protection could cause an assertion failure during fast index
	creation. Also, add UNIV_MEM_ALLOC and UNIV_MEM_FREE instrumentation
	to os_mem_alloc_large() and os_mem_free_large(), so that Valgrind can
	detect more errors.

2009-02-11	The InnoDB Team

	* handler/ha_innodb.cc:
	Make innodb_thread_concurrency=0 the default. The old default value
	was 8. A non-zero setting may be useful when InnoDB is showing severe
	scalability problems under multiple concurrent connections.

2009-02-10	The InnoDB Team

	* handler/ha_innodb.cc, handler/ha_innodb.h:
	Fix Bug#41676 Table names are case insensitive in locking

2009-02-10	The InnoDB Team

	* mem/mem0dbg.c, mem/mem0mem.c, mem/mem0pool.c:
	When innodb_use_sys_malloc is set, ignore
	innodb_additional_mem_pool_size, because nothing will be allocated
	from mem_comm_pool.

2009-02-10	The InnoDB Team

	* ut/ut0mem.c:
	Map ut_malloc_low(), ut_realloc(), and ut_free() directly to malloc(),
	realloc(), and free() when innodb_use_sys_malloc is set. As a side
	effect, ut_total_allocated_memory ("Total memory allocated" in the
	"BUFFER POOL AND MEMORY" section of SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS) will
	exclude any memory allocated by these functions when
	innodb_use_sys_malloc is set.

	On those platforms that support it, implement the synchronization
	primitives of InnoDB mutexes and read/write locks with GCC atomic
	builtins instead of Pthreads mutexes and InnoDB mutexes. These changes
	are based on a patch supplied by Mark Callaghan of Google under a BSD

	* handler/ha_innodb.cc, ibuf/ibuf0ibuf.c, include/ibuf0ibuf.h,
	include/ibuf0ibuf.ic:
	Implement the settable global variable innodb_change_buffering,
	with the allowed values 'none' and 'inserts'. The default value
	'inserts' enables the buffering of inserts to non-unique secondary
	index trees when the B-tree leaf page is not in the buffer pool.

2009-01-27	The InnoDB Team

	* buf/buf0lru.c:
	Fix a race condition in buf_LRU_invalidate_tablespace(): The
	compressed page size (zip_size) was read while the block descriptor
	was no longer protected by a mutex. This could lead to corruption
	when a table is dropped on a busy system that contains compressed
	tables.

2009-01-26	The InnoDB Team

	include/mtr0log.ic, include/row0upd.ic, mtr/mtr0mtr.c:
	Implement buf_block_align() with pointer arithmetics, as it is in the
	built-in InnoDB distributed with MySQL. Do not acquire the buffer pool
	mutex before buf_block_align(). This removes a scalability bottleneck
	in the adaptive hash index lookup. In CHECK TABLE, check that
	buf_pool->page_hash is consistent with buf_block_align().

2009-01-23	The InnoDB Team

	* btr/btr0sea.c:

	UNIV_DEBUG is enabled.

2009-01-09	The InnoDB Team

	* buf/buf0flu.c, include/buf0flu.h, include/buf0flu.ic:
	Remove unused code from the functions
	buf_flush_insert_into_flush_list() and
	buf_flush_insert_sorted_into_flush_list().

2009-01-09	The InnoDB Team

	* buf/buf0flu.c:
	Simplify the functions buf_flush_try_page() and buf_flush_batch(). Add
	debug assertions and an explanation to buf_flush_write_block_low().

2009-01-07	The InnoDB Team

	mysql-test/innodb-use-sys-malloc.result,
	mysql-test/innodb-use-sys-malloc.test, srv/srv0srv.c, srv/srv0start.c:
	Implement the configuration parameter innodb_use_sys_malloc (false by
	default), for disabling InnoDB's internal memory allocator and using
	system malloc/free instead. The "BUFFER POOL AND MEMORY" section of
	SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS will report "in additional pool allocated
	allocated 0" when innodb_use_sys_malloc is set.

2008-12-30	The InnoDB Team

	* btr/btr0btr.c:
	When setting the PAGE_LEVEL of a compressed B-tree page from or to 0,
	compress the page at the same time. This is necessary, because the
	column information stored on the compressed page will differ between
	leaf and non-leaf pages. Leaf pages are identified by PAGE_LEVEL=0.
	This bug can make InnoDB crash when all rows of a compressed table are
	deleted.

2008-12-17	The InnoDB Team

	* include/row0sel.h, include/row0upd.h, pars/pars0pars.c,
	row/row0mysql.c, row/row0sel.c, row/row0upd.c:
	Remove update-in-place select from the internal SQL interpreter. It
	was only used for updating the InnoDB internal data dictionary when
	renaming or dropping tables. It could have caused deadlocks when
	acquiring latches on insert buffer bitmap pages.

	Introduce the preprocessor symbol UNIV_AHI_DEBUG for enabling adaptive
	hash index debugging independently of UNIV_DEBUG.

2008-12-16	The InnoDB Team

	* btr/btr0cur.c:
	Do not update the free bits in the insert buffer bitmap when inserting
	or deleting from the insert buffer B-tree. Assert that records in the
	insert buffer B-tree are never updated.

2008-12-12	The InnoDB Team

	* buf/buf0buf.c, fil/fil0fil.c, fsp/fsp0fsp.c, ibuf/ibuf0ibuf.c,
	include/fil0fil.h, include/ibuf0ibuf.h, include/ibuf0ibuf.ic,
	include/ibuf0types.h:
	Clean up the insert buffer subsystem so that only one insert
	buffer B-tree exists.
	Originally, there were provisions in InnoDB for multiple insert
	buffer B-trees, apparently one for each tablespace.
	When Heikki Tuuri implemented multiple InnoDB tablespaces in
	MySQL/InnoDB 4.1, he made the insert buffer live only in the
	system tablespace (space 0) but left the provisions in the code.

2008-12-11	The InnoDB Team

	* include/srv0srv.h, os/os0proc.c, srv/srv0srv.c:
	Fix the issue that the InnoDB plugin fails if innodb_buffer_pool_size
	is defined bigger than 4096M on 64-bit Windows. This bug should not
	have affected other 64-bit systems.

2008-12-09	The InnoDB Team

2008-12-02	The InnoDB Team

	* page/page0cur.c:
	When allocating space for a record from the free list of previously
	purged records, zero out the DB_TRX_ID and DB_ROLL_PTR of the purged
	record if the new record would not overwrite these fields. This fixes
	a harmless content mismatch reported by page_zip_validate().

2008-12-02	The InnoDB Team

	* row/row0merge.c:
	Replace the WHILE 1 with WHILE 1=1 in the SQL procedure, so that the

2008-10-23	The InnoDB Team

	* ibuf/ibuf0ibuf.c:
	ibuf_delete_rec(): When the cursor to the insert buffer record
	cannot be restored, do not complain if the tablespace does not
	exist, because the insert buffer record may have been discarded by
	some other thread. This bug has existed in MySQL/InnoDB since

2008-10-16	The InnoDB Team

	* dict/dict0dict.c, mysql-test/innodb-index.result,
	mysql-test/innodb-index.test:
	Skip the undo log size check when creating REDUNDANT and COMPACT
	tables. In ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC and ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED, column
	prefix indexes require that prefixes of externally stored columns
	be written to the undo log. This may make the undo log record
	bigger than the record on the B-tree page. The maximum size of an
	undo log record is the page size. That must be checked for, in
	dict_index_add_to_cache(). However, this restriction must not
	be enforced on REDUNDANT or COMPACT tables.

2008-10-15	The InnoDB Team

	* btr/btr0cur.c, include/btr0cur.h, row/row0ext.c, row/row0sel.c,
	row/row0upd.c:
	When the server crashes while freeing an externally stored column
	of a compressed table, the BTR_EXTERN_LEN field in the BLOB
	pointer will be written as 0. Tolerate this in the functions that
	deal with externally stored columns. This fixes problems after
	crash recovery, in the rollback of incomplete transactions, and in
	the purge of delete-marked records.

2008-10-15	The InnoDB Team

	* btr/btr0btr.c, include/page0zip.h, page/page0zip.c, include/univ.i:
	When a B-tree node of a compressed table is split or merged, the
	compression may fail. In this case, the entire compressed page
	will be copied and the excess records will be deleted. However,
	page_zip_copy(), now renamed to page_zip_copy_recs(), copied too
	many fields in the page header, overwriting PAGE_BTR_SEG_LEAF and
	PAGE_BTR_SEG_TOP when splitting the B-tree root. This caused
	corruption of compressed tables. Furthermore, the lock table and
	the adaptive hash index would be corrupted, because we forgot to
	update them when invoking page_zip_copy_recs().

	Introduce the symbol UNIV_ZIP_DEBUG for triggering the copying of
	compressed pages more often, for debugging purposes.

2008-10-10	The InnoDB Team

	* handler/handler0alter.cc, include/row0merge.h, row/row0merge.c,
	row/row0mysql.c:
	Fix some locking issues, mainly in fast index creation. The
	InnoDB data dictionary cache should be latched whenever a
	transaction is holding locks on any data dictionary tables.
	Otherwise, lock waits or deadlocks could occur. Furthermore, the
	data dictionary transaction must be committed (and the locks
	released) before the data dictionary latch is released.

	ha_innobase::add_index(): Lock the data dictionary before renaming
	or dropping the created indexes, because neither operation will
	commit the data dictionary transaction.

	ha_innobase::final_drop_index(): Commit the transactions before
	unlocking the data dictionary.

2008-10-09	The InnoDB Team

	* buf/buf0lru.c:

	* dict/dict0crea.c, trx/trx0roll.c, include/row0mysql.h,
	row/row0merge.c, row/row0mysql.c:
	When dropping a table, hold the data dictionary latch until the
	transaction has been committed. The data dictionary latch is
	supposed to prevent lock waits and deadlocks in the data
	dictionary tables. Due to this bug, DROP TABLE could cause a
	deadlock or hang. Note that because of Bug#33650 and Bug#39833,
	MySQL may also drop a (temporary) table when executing CREATE INDEX
	or ALTER TABLE ... ADD INDEX.

	For uncompressed tables, there should always be enough space for
	two records in an empty B-tree page. For compressed tables, there
	should be enough space for storing two node pointer records or one
	data record in an empty page in uncompressed format.
	The purpose of this check is to guarantee that INSERT or UPDATE
