PrimeBase XT for MySQL 5.1
==========================

This is the PrimeBase XT (PBXT) transactional storage engine for MySQL. PBXT is "pluggable", which means that it can be loaded dynamically by MySQL at runtime. It uses a unique "write-once" update strategy and MVCC (multi-version concurrency control) to provide optimal performance over a wide range of tasks.

This package includes the complete source code for the engine. Although this is a standalone project it must be built against a compiled version of the MySQL 5.1 source tree, because it references headers files used internally by the server.

Details about how to build PBXT both under UNIX or Windows, as a standalone plug-in, or as part of the MySQL source code, is distribed in the documentation which is avaliable online at:
