# BUG#47312: RBR: Disabling key on slave breaks replication:
# HA_ERR_WRONG_INDEX
#
# Description
# ===========
#   
#   This test case checks whether disabling a key on a slave breaks
#   replication or not.
#   
#   Case #1, shows that while not using ALTER TABLE... DISABLE KEYS and
#   the slave has no key defined while the master has one, replication
#   won't break.
#
#   Case #2, shows that before patch for BUG#47312, if defining key on
#   slave table, and later disable it, replication would break. This
#   has been fixed.

# Case #2: master has key, slave also has one, 
#          but it gets disabled sometime.
#          Replication does not break anymore.
