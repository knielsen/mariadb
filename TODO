  methods.

Features recoded
- Better error messages
- Added support of timestamps to ha_write and ha_update.

Fetures half done:
- Support for TRANSACTION READ ONLY | READ WRITE
- CF_XXX states added to init_update_queries() but not otherwise used.
- Merge sql/rpl_mi.cc (To get Sys_ssl_crl ? crlpath)

Short time TODO:
- Add support for TRANSACTION READ ONLY | READ WRITE in sql_yacc.yy
  (support for variable tx_read_only)

- merge hostname.cc / hostname.h
- add support for host_error()

- Enable performance_schema.host_cache in scripts/mysql_system_tables.sql

- Add full support for timestamp. (remove timestamp handling from ha_write())

- Add  Sys_my_bind_addr(); Needed for perfschema

- Add THD_STAGE_INFO everywhere.

- mysql_socket_shutdown() was removed from vio/viosocket.cc.
  It was replaced with inline function in include/mysql/psi/mysql_socket.h
  but this doesn't call DisconnectEx(). We should check if we need to
  add this to the inline function...
